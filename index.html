                I'm currently in 2nd Semester of my Bachelors in Computer Science. I've always loved technology and wanted to do something tech related. 
                I took a CS class in High School that taught me the basics of coding and web pages. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to major in Computer science. 
                I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I was 9 when my family moved to America. I struggled a lot with school at first but overtime I got better. I was in the National Honor society program in High school.
                My goal is to graduate SUNY New Paltz with good GPA.
